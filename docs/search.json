    "text": "Description of the course\nIn this course, students will gain a deep understanding of the fundamental principles related to renewable energy production, including areas like hydrogen production and wind energy. The curriculum integrates theoretical knowledge with hands-on practical calculations, equipping students with the proficiency to model renewable energy production processes effectively.\nStudents will enhance their expertise in data analysis and modelling, essential skills for the renewable energy sector. They will be capable of conducting resource potential assessments, select optimal installation sites, and performing cost-benefit analyses to optimize renewable energy projects.\nKnowledge:\nSkills:\nGeneral Competences:\nThe data have been analysed with R (version 4.3.1) and Rstudio, and the book has been created with Quarto. You may need to install the following packages:\nThis work has been financed by XXX"
